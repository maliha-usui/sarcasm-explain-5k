0,non_sarcastic,I just wonder sometimes just how much Laimbeer would be hated on r/nba.,"Hate myself for loving this team so much. I just can't help but love the bad guys, that's how I was raised. :')",,,,,,
0,non_sarcastic,Free weekend happened.,"What happened to the community? :'( Hey everyone! I just decided to start playing this game again after other things (life, other games) took over. I was really excited because I remembered the community around the launch of Early Access to be nice, communicative, and overall helpful. The game felt fun. I used to play a lot of MOBAs, and this was a breath of fresh air. In the four games today (Christmas, of all days) I've had three teammates tell me that I'm ""absolute shit"" and to go ""kill myself"". What happened to this community? It feels like a MOBA community (not quite as bad as LoL, but it's starting to have a familiar feel to me) more than it used to feel just like a bunch of people trying to compete yet still enjoying the competition, even if someone is having a bad game. It makes me hesitant to keep at it, and I was excited about getting back into it. :'(",,,,,,

0,non_sarcastic,"The ""commanders"" have no say in the matter, it is basically a direct line between the president and the missile silo.","I admit that I don't know how the system actually works, but I honestly doubt that any senior military commanders would launch a first strike on Trump's say-so. I pray we don't have a system that would let Trump take his little ""football"" briefcase into some bathroom and start pressing buttons that actually make things happen.",,,,,,

0,non_sarcastic,You beat me to this,"Haha this brings up another topic. Step 1: be attractive. If these chicks were hot, people would be patting that kid on the back, which is absurd.",,,,,,
0,non_sarcastic,"I honestly wouldnt mind if DE decided to take a look at all weapons that were ""X weapon but worse in every way"" and give them some unique mechanic so that we dont just have like 20-30 useless weapons compared to the others.","Has DE Learned to Work Around Power Creep? Let me start by saying power creep will always be a thing in WF and I do not see that ever stopping. I do however believe that DE has taken some steps to slowing it. Passives are amazing! They change not only how you build weapons and what you decide to use but also how you play the game. A perfect example is the Telos Boltace which is quickly becoming a go to melee. Is it as powerful as the Galatine Prime? Debatable, but for killing a single tanky target no. But the way you play with the Telos Boltace changes everything. A somewhat good example of how weapon passives change the game is the Borderlands series. I would never want to see WF be as crazy as Borderlands, but some this are already starting to line up. For instance the Fomorian Accelerant mod for the Drakgoon adds a passive to make shots bounce off walls. This is similar to the Conferance Call shotgun in Borderlands 2. Furis's Winds of Purity mod turns it into a Moxie weapon. Why cant warframe have weapons that you can throw the clip out to explode doing damage equal to the bullets remaining? Or a sniper rifle the shoots a volley like Ivaras bow? Just add more cool passives and players will build around them.",,,,,,
