The listener needs to understand the context of who Jeffery Simmons is and the implications of being compared to him in order to grasp the sarcasm.","In the sarcastic comment, the speaker is implicitly mocking the idea of someone being like Jeffery Simmons, implying that Simmons is not a positive role model or example to follow. A sincere version would not have this mocking tone and may genuinely be asking if someone shares similarities or traits with Jeffery Simmons.","The sarcasm in this comment lies in the comparison to Jeffery Simmons, implying that the person being compared is not like him at all. This is likely because Jeffery Simmons is a highly talented and successful individual, so the comparison is meant to highlight the inadequacy or failure of the person being referred to.","The sarcasm in this comment is based on the unexpected reversal between the literal meaning of the words and the intended meaning.

1,sarcastic,But Trump is going to cause the apocalypse and is Hitler and Stalin multiplied by a billion.,"vote your conscience only if we agree, hypocrisy at it's finest","""Trump is not going to cause the apocalypse and is not equivalent to Hitler and Stalin combined by a billion.""",The sarcasm in the original comment stems from an exaggeration of Trump's perceived negative qualities. The speaker is using hyperbole to mock the idea that Trump is as destructive as historical figures like Hitler and Stalin.,The speaker is exaggerating to mock the extreme negative views some people have of Trump. They likely do not actually believe he is equivalent to Hitler and Stalin. The sarcasm is used to make a point about the hyperbolic language used in political discourse. The listener needs to understand the speaker's intention of satire and exaggeration to grasp the sarcasm.,The comment is sarcastic because it exaggerates and uses extreme hyperbole to mock or ridicule the idea that Trump is as villainous and destructive as Hitler and Stalin combined. A sincere version would express genuine concern or criticism about Trump's actions without resorting to over-the-top comparisons to history's most infamous dictators.,"The sarcasm in this comment is evident through the extreme exaggeration of comparing Trump to Hitler and Stalin multiplied by a billion. This comparison is obviously over-the-top and not meant to be taken seriously, highlighting the absurdity of the statement. Additionally, the idea that Trump is going to cause the apocalypse is a hyperbolic prediction meant to poke fun at the fear-mongering rhetoric often used in political discourse. Overall, the comment is meant to be seen as an exaggerated and ironic criticism of Trump.",The use of extreme hyperbolic language and comparisons to notorious historical figures are cues that indicate sarcasm in the original comment. The sincere version clearly states the speaker's true beliefs without the exaggerated language.
1,sarcastic,You get ad from maw,so you telling us not to build AD on AD carry? :thinking:,You receive a lot of advertisements from your mother.,The sarcasm in the original comment comes from the implication that receiving advertisements from one's own mother is unusual or humorous.,The speaker is implying that the listener's source of information is unreliable or untrustworthy. They may believe that the listener's understanding is skewed or incorrect. The speaker's goal is to mock or belittle the listener in a playful manner. The listener needs to understand that the comment is meant to be sarcastic and not to be taken seriously.,"The sarcastic comment ""You get ad from maw"" is mocking and insincere because it is making fun of the way someone might speak in a condescending or dismissive tone. A sincere version would be something like ""You receive advertisements from your mother,"" which would be a straightforward and neutral statement without any mocking or sarcastic undertones.","The sarcasm in this comment stems from the exaggeration and contradiction present. The idea that someone would receive an ad from their mother is absurd and unrealistic, highlighting the ridiculousness of the situation. This is a clear example of sarcasm as it plays on the reader's understanding of how advertisements are usually targeted towards specific audiences, not family members.","The comment ""You get ad from maw"" is sarcastic because it involves a contradiction between the literal and the intended meaning. The phrase ""get ad from maw"" suggests receiving something from a family member, which in a typical situation would be a positive interaction. However, the sarcastic tone comes from the fact that receiving ads from a family member would not be a positive experience, as ads are usually seen as intrusive or annoying. This unexpected reversal of expectations creates the sarcastic effect in this comment."
1,sarcastic,Just follow the left wall dude.,Send help,Please follow the left wall.,The sarcastic comment implies that the task of following the left wall is so simple that it is being stated in a condescending manner.,The speaker is expressing frustration or annoyance at the listener by sarcastically suggesting an overly simplistic solution to a problem. They likely believe the listener is not listening or taking the situation seriously. The speaker may be attempting to make the listener feel foolish or inadequate for not figuring out the solution themselves. The listener needs to understand the context that simply following a wall would not necessarily solve the problem at hand.,"The sarcastic comment ""Just follow the left wall dude"" is mocking the idea of a simple solution to a complex problem. It implies that the solution given is overly simplistic and not truly helpful. In contrast, a sincere version would provide genuine guidance and support, such as offering specific directions or advice on how to navigate a maze.","The sarcasm in this comment comes from the exaggeration of suggesting a simple solution to a potentially complex problem. By saying ""just follow the left wall,"" the speaker is implying that the solution is obvious and easy, when in reality it may not be as straightforward as they are making it out to be.","The comment is sarcastic because it suggests a simple solution to a complex problem, implying that navigating through a maze is as easy as following a wall. This exaggerated simplicity contradicts the reality of the situation, where getting lost in a maze is not easily solved by such a straightforward approach. The mismatch between the literal instruction to follow a wall and the intended meaning of finding a way out of the maze adds an element of irony, highlighting the absurdity of the suggestion."
1,sarcastic,Clearly what this shows is that SF5 isn't a legitimate measure of aptitude.,ALL USA WINNER'S FINALS ASIAN DICKRIDERS ON SUICIDE WATCH,It appears that SF5 may not accurately assess aptitude.,The speaker is using sarcasm to imply that SF5 is not a valid measure of aptitude.,"The speaker is expressing their belief that SF5 is indeed a legitimate measure of aptitude, but they are doing so sarcastically to mock someone who may have criticized the game's validity. Their goal is to indirectly challenge or ridicule the other person's viewpoint. The listener needs to understand the context of potential criticism towards SF5 and the speaker's sarcastic tone to interpret the intended message accurately.","The sarcastic comment implies that SF5 is a valid measure of aptitude by stating the opposite. The speaker is actually suggesting that SF5 is not a legitimate measure of aptitude, despite the sarcastic wording. A sincere version would directly state that SF5 is not a legitimate measure of aptitude without the sarcastic tone.","The sarcasm in this comment is evident through the exaggerated claim that Street Fighter 5 (SF5) is not a legitimate measure of aptitude. The speaker is implying that SF5 is actually a valid measure of skill, but is saying the opposite in a sarcastic manner. This is likely due to the fact that SF5 is a popular competitive fighting game known for testing players' abilities and reflexes.","The sarcastic tone is conveyed through the use of the word ""clearly"" and the negative judgment of SF5 as not being a ""legitimate measure of aptitude."""
1,sarcastic,Cuz thats gay duh,why is it weird for a dude to call another dude handsome but girls call other girls beautiful all the time,"""Because that is homosexual, obviously.""","The speaker is using sarcasm to mock the use of the word ""gay"" as a derogatory term.","The speaker likely believes that using the word ""gay"" in a derogatory manner is inappropriate and offensive, but they are using sarcasm to mock someone who may think otherwise. The goal is to highlight the ignorance and insensitivity behind using the term in a negative context. The listener needs to understand the speaker's stance on LGBTQ+ issues and their use of sarcasm to grasp the intended meaning.","The use of the word ""gay"" in a derogatory manner implies that being gay is negative or less than desirable, which is not only offensive but also perpetuates harmful stereotypes. In a sincere version, the comment might say something like ""Because that's the way I feel comfortable expressing myself,"" without using a marginalized group as a derogatory term.","The sarcasm in this comment is evident in the use of the word ""gay"" as a derogatory term, which is meant to mock the idea being discussed. The sarcastic tone is also emphasized by the dismissive and simplistic response of ""duh,"" which implies that the reasoning is so obvious that it should be understood without question. This comment is not meant to be taken seriously and is intended to be mocking and disrespectful.","The use of the word ""duh"" and the derogatory term ""gay"" indicate that the comment is meant sarcastically."
1,sarcastic,It's a state of mind,ELI5 Digital India I've seen Reliance Jio and PayTM thanking 'Digital India' in their ads. What on earth is Digital India though? I tried going to the website but honestly it sucks. There is nothing clear on it. * What are the goals? * What is the plan? * What exactly is the roadmap? * Who is paying for all the marketing? And how much? * What is the government doing? Can someone help me with this?,It is a mental state.,"This sarcastic comment implies that the concept being discussed is not a tangible reality, but rather a subjective perception or feeling.","The speaker likely believes that the concept being discussed is not just a state of mind, but something more tangible or important. They may be trying to convey their skepticism or dismissiveness towards the idea. The speaker could be aiming to provoke thought or challenge the listener's perspective. To understand the sarcasm, the listener needs to be aware of the context of the conversation and the speaker's attitude towards the topic.","The sarcastic tone in the comment ""It's a state of mind"" is evident in the dismissive and flippant way it is stated. The speaker is likely belittling the concept or implying that it is not important.

A sincere version of this statement would be more earnest and respectful, acknowledging the significance of one's mindset in a genuine way. It might sound something like, ""Having a positive mindset can truly make a difference in how we approach challenges.""","The sarcasm in this comment lies in the dismissive and flippant way in which the speaker refers to ""it"" as simply a ""state of mind,"" implying that the concept being discussed is trivial or insignificant. This sarcastic tone is conveyed through the lack of seriousness and depth in the statement, suggesting that the speaker is belittling the idea.","The sarcasm in this comment is conveyed through the tone of dismissal or belittlement towards the idea of a state of mind, implying that it is insignificant or trivial."

0,non_sarcastic,Free weekend happened.,"What happened to the community? :'( Hey everyone! I just decided to start playing this game again after other things (life, other games) took over. I was really excited because I remembered the community around the launch of Early Access to be nice, communicative, and overall helpful. The game felt fun. I used to play a lot of MOBAs, and this was a breath of fresh air. In the four games today (Christmas, of all days) I've had three teammates tell me that I'm ""absolute shit"" and to go ""kill myself"". What happened to this community? It feels like a MOBA community (not quite as bad as LoL, but it's starting to have a familiar feel to me) more than it used to feel just like a bunch of people trying to compete yet still enjoying the competition, even if someone is having a bad game. It makes me hesitant to keep at it, and I was excited about getting back into it. :'(",,,,,,

0,non_sarcastic,"I honestly wouldnt mind if DE decided to take a look at all weapons that were ""X weapon but worse in every way"" and give them some unique mechanic so that we dont just have like 20-30 useless weapons compared to the others.","Has DE Learned to Work Around Power Creep? Let me start by saying power creep will always be a thing in WF and I do not see that ever stopping. I do however believe that DE has taken some steps to slowing it. Passives are amazing! They change not only how you build weapons and what you decide to use but also how you play the game. A perfect example is the Telos Boltace which is quickly becoming a go to melee. Is it as powerful as the Galatine Prime? Debatable, but for killing a single tanky target no. But the way you play with the Telos Boltace changes everything. A somewhat good example of how weapon passives change the game is the Borderlands series. I would never want to see WF be as crazy as Borderlands, but some this are already starting to line up. For instance the Fomorian Accelerant mod for the Drakgoon adds a passive to make shots bounce off walls. This is similar to the Conferance Call shotgun in Borderlands 2. Furis's Winds of Purity mod turns it into a Moxie weapon. Why cant warframe have weapons that you can throw the clip out to explode doing damage equal to the bullets remaining? Or a sniper rifle the shoots a volley like Ivaras bow? Just add more cool passives and players will build around them.",,,,,,
